## Group Clarity's submission for ETHGlobal Singapore

Clarity is a payment gateway designed to tackle the multibillion-dollar problem of fake reviews by enabling seamless, verifiable on-chain payments and reviews.

### Summary of the problem
Fake reviews mislead consumers, create unfair competition, erode trust in online platforms, and distort marketplace dynamics, leading to financial and reputational harm for both businesses and customers.
Extent of the problem

Fake reviews are widespread, with estimates suggesting that up to 42% of reviews on major platforms like Amazon could be fake, costing global businesses over $152 billion annually. Consumers are increasingly aware of the issue, with 62% believing they've encountered fake reviews in the past year.

### Key Reasons
- Bots: Automated systems generate fake reviews in bulk, inflating ratings for products or services.
- One Person Having Multiple Accounts: Individuals create multiple accounts to post numerous fake reviews, artificially boosting or harming a productâ€™s reputation.
- Censored or Edited Reviews: Platforms or sellers manipulate reviews by censoring negative feedback or selectively editing them to present products in a more favourable light.
- Opaqueness of existing review systems: Users have little to no insights into how existing review mechanisms work, and whether transactions have been made for the product/service being reviewed.
