  3 Types of Proxy Patterns:
  
  1. Diamond Pattern (EIP-2532)
  
  An upgradeable proxy pattern in which there are multiple logic contracts (facets) instead of one. Whenever a function is called in the diamond proxy contract, it checks the hash table (mapping) to see which facet has the function defined and then delegates the call to that facet. This delegatecall occurs in the proxyâ€™s fallback() method. We can add or remove any number of methods from any facet in a single transaction using a method called diamondCut(). In order to avoid storage collisions, this pattern uses the DiamondStorage technique. It also allows the developers to implement logic in facets, independent of other facets.
  
  
  2. Transparent Proxy Pattern
  
  The logic layer (i.e., the implementation contract) is separated from the storage layer (i.e., the proxy contract) and all calls to the proxy contract are delegated to the logic contract.
  
  This method worked just fine until It was fine until a malicious backdoor, proxy selector clashing, was identified and addressed. Proxy selector clashing occurs when two or more methods have identical function signatures in the proxy and logic contract. This can lead to smart contract exploits.
  
  To resolve the clashing, OpenZeppelin introduced the transparent proxy pattern. This pattern allows identical function signatures to exist in the proxy and logic contract, but the delegatecall to the logic contract only occurs if the caller is not a contract admin. Otherwise, the function is invoked in the proxy contract itself if it exists or reverts if not.
  
  
  3. UUPS Proxy Pattern
  
  The UUPS proxy pattern is similar to the transparent proxy pattern, except the upgrade is triggered via the logic contract rather than from the proxy contract.
  
  There is a unique storage slot in the proxy contract to store the address of the logic contract that it points to. Whenever the logic contract is upgraded, that storage slot is updated with the new logic contract address. The function to upgrade the contracts should be a protected function to avoid unauthorized access. Also, this provides the ability to go completely non-upgradeable gradually as the logic contract can completely remove the upgradeTo() method in the new implementation if needed.
